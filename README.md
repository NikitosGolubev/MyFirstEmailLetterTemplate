# My First Email Letter Template
June, 2016.

# My memories
Well, it's a crucial project for me. After I've done with my first template I've decided to go on freelance and make some money! (Yeah, the kinda ridiculous idea with such weak skillset BUT it seemed to me quite rational at that time. Btw, I don't regret :) ). I was browsing freelance service for quite long, and I guess you understand that it's almost impossible to find a paid work and successfully complete it having just minimum and poor knowledge of HTML and CSS. But that time I thought I have enough background to get paid. To my current surprise I was right! Somehow I've found a client who has needed to develop email letter at least amount of money possible. I offered myself and he's agreed. Then the story began.

Firstly, I've not been even aware of what email later is in terms of development and I've started creating the landing page. To my regret that was not the thing, my client expected and after work was completed he said to me that I misunderstood the task. Luckily, he hadn't tight deadlines and offered me the solution. I had to quickly figure out what email latter is (and details of developing it) and rebuilt everything. So that's the thing I've done! And you know? - I was proud of myself when I received my first 100% DESERVED money for work on the Internet. As you can imagine, this occasion dramatically boosted my motivation, inspiration, and confidence for further learning and practicing. So I thank God that he's given me the work such early and a magnificent client. Other words, - I nailed it.

# Skills applied
+ HTML (particularly tables)
+ Inline CSS styles
+ The ability to learn rapidly to eliminate my mistake.
